The problem is to design a data model for an Uber-like transportation 
service that can handle user location tracking, driver acceptance 
or rejection of ride requests, payment processing 
through card transactions, and storing information about 
both the driver and the user. The data model should be efficient 
and scalable to handle a large number of
users and transactions while ensuring data privacy and security.
